If you have recently changed keyboard layouts on Windows 7, you might have realized the logon screen isn't necessarily changing its keyboard layout.

To fix this, go in **Control Panel**, **Region and Language**, **Administrative**, **Welcome screen and new user accounts** and click **Copy Settings**
