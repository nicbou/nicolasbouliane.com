I built [a website](https://allaboutberlin.com/) and I live from it. This appeals to a lot of people, and from a distance, my job looks really easy, so I get asked about monetisation a lot. This post is the answer I always want to give.

First, the short answer: affiliate links.

People need help on their journey. I get them as far as I can, but I'm not a lawyer, a tax advisor or a bank. When I refer my readers to a business I work with, I get a commission. Simple as that.

## How the whole internet works

That's not an original recipe. It's how everyone else does it too. Every content creator you can think of likely gets paid a commission to sell things.

My only secret ingredient is integrity. I link advertisers to [this page](https://allaboutberlin.com/impressum#content-policy) until they get the point.

See, content creators get greedy, then sloppy. When you're paid by commission, it's tempting to just sell sell sell. "Best health insurance? The one that pays the fattest commissions. Best bank? They're all great, except the ones we don't partner with. Is this product good? We never tried it but yes, and we'd lose of a lot of money if we said otherwise."

If everything you read feels like a sales pitch, it's because [everything *is* a sales pitch](http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html). Many content creators are just a few Google searches ahead of you, paraphrasing someone else and adding their own affiliate links. They're salespeople, not advisors.

This is so normalised that advertisers routinely ask me to conform to their PR guidelines. It's often in their contract. [My advertising policy](https://allaboutberlin.com/impressum#advertising-policy) is the most polite "absolutely fucking not" I could write.

## The honest broker

I am not a salesman, but an [honest broker](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/how-i-became-the-honest-broker).

> Their influence and power is built solely on a reputation for straight talk and trustworthy dealings.

## The honest, unbiased truth can cost you sales, but it wins you customers. Nothing signals honesty like "try this free alternative instead".

My niche is not Germany's byzantine bureaucracy, it's honesty. The supply has crashed, and the demand is stratospheric.

Everyone is looking for a shortcut to financial independence, a simple, risk-free way to eventually tell their boss to shove it.
