Every January, all sorts of things change in Germany as new laws come into effect. As soon as the noise fireworks dies down, I must get to work updating [All About Berlin](https://allaboutberlin.com)'s guides and calculators.

This year is no different. This is a summary of the changes that I believe affect most of my readers.

## Minimum wage

Minimum wage was raised from 12.41€ to 12.82€ per hour. The maximum minijob income was raised from 538€ to 556€ per month.

## Public transit

Public transit got 7.53% more expensive on average, despite [massive budget cuts](https://berlin-haushalt25.nand.io/), [service reductions](https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2024/09/u-bahn-berlin-taktanpassung-bvg-fahrplan.html) and [punctuality issues](https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/mensch-metropole/bvg-verspaetungen-ausfaelle-erreichen-rekordwerte-li.2186326).[^1] Ticket prices had already gone up by 6.7% in January 2024.

AB and ABC tickets are 30 cents more expensive (3.80€ and 4.70€). The Deutschland Ticket is 9€ more expensive (58€). The Monatskarte is 7.50€ more expensive (106.50€). The 29€ and the Azubi tickets are gone.

On the bright side, we're getting [more trains and a better information system](https://entwicklungsstadt.de/modernisierung-im-nahverkehr-neue-u-bahn-waggons-der-bvg/).

## Health insurance

Public health insurance got more expensive across the board. You must pay an extra 1% of your income for health insurance: 0.2% for nursing care insurance, and an average of 0.8% for the insurer surcharge.

Use my [health insurance calculator](https://allaboutberlin.com/tools/health-insurance-calculator) to see how much you now pay for health insurance. It will be updated on January 1.

## Immigration

The minimum income for the Blue Card went up 6.6% (48,300€ or 43,760€ depending on your profession).

The minimum income for the freelance visa has not changed: it's your rent + your health insurance + 563€.

I am finishing a complete overhaul of my [residence permit guides](https://allaboutberlin.com/collections/immigration). The instructions are better and clearer than ever.

As far as I know, there are no big immigration reforms coming. However the Berlin immigration office is rapidly digitalising residence permit applications. So far, it led to faster processing times. However, the digital permanent residence application introduced [new requirements](https://old.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/1hb05e2/permanent_residence_applications_are_now_digital/) like a language test and an integration test, so it's a mixed blessing.

## Taxes

The income tax calculation was retroactively adjusted for all of 2024. You will pay less income tax, so that's nice! As for every other year, the 2025 calculation was adjusted for inflation. This means that if your income stayed the same in 2025, you will pay a little less income tax.

Use my [tax calculator](https://allaboutberlin.com/tools/tax-calculator) to see how much taxes you now pay. It will updated by January 1.

Things also changed for small businesses. The maximum income for [*Kleinunternehmer*](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/kleinunternehmer) was raised from 22,000€-50,000€ to 25,000€-100,000€. Small businesses can choose not to charge VAT.

## Digitalisation

Berlin significantly cut it's digitalisation budget. This is the opposite of what the *Rechnungshof* recommended in its very spicy report in November. This might not be the year Berlin will enter the digital age.
