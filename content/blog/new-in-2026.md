title: What's new for Berliners in 2026
description: A brief summary of changes that affect most immigrants in Berlin.

Every year, on the first of January, prices change and new laws come into effect. Mostly, life gets a little more expensive.

And thus, every year, I spend a few days updating [All About Berlin](https://allaboutberlin.com)'s hundreds of pages and calculators. This is a summary of the changes I have noticed.

## Restaurants

Eating out will get cheaper. Cafés and restaurants will charge 7% [VAT](https://allaboutberlin.com/glossary/Umsatzsteuer) instead of 19%.

## Public transit

After a rough start, the BVG's punctuality has [steadily improved](https://entwicklungsstadt.de/bvg-auf-dem-weg-zu-mehr-zuverlaessigkeit-erste-zahlen-machen-hoffnung/) throughout 2025. The S-Bahn [got worse](https://www.nd-aktuell.de/artikel/1195005.oepnv-mehr-ausfaelle-und-verspaetungen-die-s-bahn-berlin-und-das-elend.html). However, you can count on one thing to arrive on time: the yearly price increase.[^4]

- Deutschland Ticket: €58 ➞ €63 (+9%)
- AB ticket: €3.80 ➞ €4 (+5%)
- ABC ticket: €4.70 ➞ €5 (+6%)

## Minimum wage and social benefits

The minimum wage and other social benefits are adjusted every year for inflation.[^1]

- Minimum wage: €12.82 ➞ €13.90 per hour (+8%)
- The maximum [minijob](https://allaboutberlin.com/glossary/Minijob) income: €556 ➞ €602  (+8%)
- Kindergeld: €255 ➞ €259 per month[^2] (+2%)
- Bürgergeld: no change

## Health insurance

- Maximum public health insurance cost: €595 ➞ €627 per month[^3] (+5%)
- Minimum public health insurance cost: €258 ➞ €272 per month[^3] (+5%)
- Student health insurance: not known yet[^5]

Last year saw one of the steepest price hikes for public health insurance. Most insurers raised their *[Zusatzbeitrag](https://allaboutberlin.com/glossary/Zusatzbeitrag)*. They are meeting in December to decide the 2026 prices.

- Techniker Krankenkasse: 2.5% ➞ not known yet
- Barmer: 3.29% ➞ not known yet
- AOK Nordost: 3.5% ➞ not known yet
- Average Zusatzbeitrag: 2.5% ➞ 2.9% (subject to change)

This is a good time to rethink your options. You can switch to a cheaper public health insurer, or to private health insurance. Try my [health insurance calculator](https://allaboutberlin.com/tools/health-insurance-calculator) or [ask my health insurance guy](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/german-health-insurance#insurance-brokers) to help you.

## Immigration

- Blue Card minimum income: €48,300 ➞ €50,700 (+5%)
- Freelance visa minimum income: not known yet[^5]

I see no big upcoming immigration reforms in 2026. The Berlin immigration office is digitalising faster and faster, and we're already seeing an improvement in wait times. Mr Djacenko and his team deserve a round of applause.

## Taxes

The income tax calculation is adjusted for inflation. The tax-free income and various other thresholds are going up. This means lower income tax for all but the top 1% of earners.

Use my [tax calculator](https://allaboutberlin.com/tools/tax-calculator) to see how much you will pay. It will be updated on January 1.

## All About Berlin

2025 was a tumultuous year for All About Berlin. ChatGPT and Google's AI summaries have eaten half of my traffic, and many of the affiliate programs I relied on have shut down. I still recommend those services, but it no longer pays my bills.

This is why I spent most of the year on rewriting my [health insurance guide](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/german-health-insurance) and improving my [health insurance calculator](https://allaboutberlin.com/tools/health-insurance-calculator). I compensated for the loss of income by improving the advice you get, and I'm pretty proud of that. I'm also *really* tired of this topic, so I'm glad it's finally over.

Now that things are stabilised, I am turning my attention back to what matters. I will spend 2026 on the content and the tools. There is a slew of meaningful updates on the way.
