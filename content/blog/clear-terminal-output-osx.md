If you want to delete all previous output in an OS X terminal window, just press Cmd + K. This will clear the output, but it won't kill the currently running tasks. I often use this command to remove thousands of lines of logs, so that the new output is easier to search.

If you just want to add some blank space, press Ctrl + L twice. This inserts a blank page in the terminal, but you can still see the previous output if you scroll up.
