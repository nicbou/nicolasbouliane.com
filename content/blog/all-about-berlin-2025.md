I have made a few resolutions going into the new year. Two of them have to do with All About Berlin.

The first resolution is to work less. I am not a workaholic by any stretch of the imagination, but I struggle to fully disconnect. You can tell by my [commit history](https://github.com/nicbou/) that I rarely take time off.

The second is to maintain the same income as last year. This is a lofty goal given that the German economy is shrinking, immigration is down, and tech giants are slowly strangling the independent web. Last fall, year-on-year traffic was down for the first time ever, by about 15%.

Given that, I must do more with less in 2025. If I want to work less while keeping the website afloat, I must be a lot more effective. This means making a few major changes to my workflow.

First, I will focus on what matters: giving useful advice. No more dilly-dallying and impulsively pursuing passion projects. Some sections of All About Berlin are in dire need of maintenance, and I will prioritise that maintenance over more exciting projects. I must also do tedious, business-y work like doing keyword research, improving SEO and building business relationships.

Second, I will no longer advise everyone individually. For years, I have answered every question that came my way. I took ["do things that don't scale"](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html) to heart, not because it made business sense, but because I loved helping people out. This is not sustainable, so I must outsource that work to tax-funded alternatives.

Third, I will cut down on policy work. Unbeknownst to most, I've tried really hard to collaborate with the local government to improve the lives of immigrants. I gave talks at CityLab, Digital Service and the Robert Bosch Stiftung, gave input, signed up for user testing, built a [community of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice) and a lot more. My most questionable move was helping the government build a direct competitor funded by your taxes. I have put a lot of time and effort into these things, but it had little tangible impact so far.

Fourth, I will network a lot more selectively. In 2024, I have met a lot of people for coffee chats. I have also been on a podcast and got interviewed by Berliner Zeitung. Basically, if you emailed me on a sunny day, I'd bike across Berlin to meet you. This year, there will be less of that. I have made many good friends that way, but I would rather meet people outside of work and talk about other things.

There is one last change in policy, unrelated to my resolutions: there will be less aggregation, and more curation.

For years, I prided myself in giving my readers the same advice I would give my best friend. This was a lie I told myself. If my friend needed an immigration lawyer I would recommend Fiona Macdonald, because that's the immigration lawyer I work with. My readers get an unsorted list of lawyers. That's not very helpful.

Sometimes, the best advice you can give someone is "try this one; it's good enough". You have to be partial, to pick winners. I'm not qualified to name the best bank or the best liability insurance, but the difference between best and one that's good enough is too small to matter.

My only concern is that genuine advice is often indistinguishable from a sales pitch. On the internet, you mostly get sales pitches, so people are suspicious of recommendations. I worry about coming off as a just another snake oil salesman on the internet.

Let's see how these changes go. I hope that they will yield to more focused, higher quality work, but if things turn out differently, I will adjust.
