I have made a few resolutions going into the new year. Two of them have to do with All About Berlin.

The first resolution is to work less. I am not a workaholic by any stretch of the imagination, but I struggle to fully disconnect. You can tell by my [commit history](https://github.com/nicbou/) that I rarely take time off.

The second is to maintain the same income as last year. This is a lofty goal given that the German economy is shrinking, immigration is down, and tech giants are slowly strangling the independent web. In late 2024, year-on-year traffic was down for the first time ever, and significantly so.

Considered together, these resolutions lead to a few changes in how I work. I must focus on working more effectively, on doing more with less. I plan to do this by treating my work like work, so that I can do less of it while still keeping the website afloat.

First, I must focus on what matters: giving useful advice. No more dilly-dallying and impulsively pursuing passion projects. Some sections of All About Berlin are in dire need of maintenance, and I will prioritise that maintenance over more exciting projects. This also involves tedious business-y work like doing keyword research, improving SEO and building business relationships.

Second, I will no longer advise everyone individually. For years, I have answered every question that came my way. I took ["do things that don't scale"](https://paulgraham.com/ds.html) to heart, not because it made business sense, but out of a genuine desire to help. However if I must decide between doing this and putting out useful public information, my choice is clear. The silver lining is that there are many competent, tax-funded entities that are there to help.

Third, I will cut down on policy work. Unbeknownst to most, I've tried really hard to collaborate with the local government to improve the lives of immigrants. I gave talks at CityLab, Digital Service and the Robert Bosch Stiftung, signed up to test new immigration processes, built a community of immigration experts and a lot more. I'm still helping the government build a direct competitor to All About Berlin. This is all meaningful work, but it took a lot of energy and so far, it had little tangible impact. I will solely focus on building a [community of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice).

Fourth, I will network a lot more selectively. In 2024, I have met a lot of people for coffee chats. I have also been on a podcast and got interviewed by Berliner Zeitung. Basically, if you emailed me on a sunny day, I'd bike across Berlin to meet you. This year, there will be less of that. I have made many good friends that way, but I would rather meet people outside of work and talk about other things.

There is one last change in policy, unrelated to my resolutions. There will be less aggregation, and more curation.

For years I prided myself in giving my readers the same advice I would give my best friend. This was a lie I told myself. If my friend needed an immigration lawyer I would recommend Fiona Macdonald, because that's the immigration lawyer *I* work with. My readers get an unsorted list of lawyers.

Sometimes, the best advice you can give someone is "try this one; it's good enough". The difference between the best option and the good enough option is too small to matter. This is how I feel about banks, liability insurance, and a few other services I mention on All About Berlin.

My main concern is that genuine advice is indistinguishable from a sales pitch. On the internet, you mostly get sales pitches. I worry that my readers will see me as just another blogger optimising for revenue.

Let's see how these changes go. I hope that they will yield to more focused, higher quality work, but if things turn out differently, I will adjust.
