Partial derivatives is something I always forget how to write when using [Markdown Notes](/projects/markdown-notes). If you are looking for the right symbols to create a partial derivative in LaTeX, this is how it's done:

```latex
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}
```

You can omit `\frac` if you don't want a vertical fraction.
