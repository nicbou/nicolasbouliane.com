I like tools that do one thing really well, and assume little about how I use them. They just do one thing, and they do it well. They interoperate with everything I use. When they stop working, I just swap them with something else.

If you work with computers, this isn't anything new. It's part of the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Mike_Gancarz:_The_UNIX_Philosophy):

> **1. Small is beautiful.**  
> **2. Make each program do one thing well.**  
> 3. Build a prototype as soon as possible.  
> 4. Choose portability over efficiency.  
> 5. Store data in flat text files.  
>  6. Use software leverage to your advantage.  
>  7. Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.  
>  8. Avoid captive user interfaces. **9. Make every program a filter.**

When you make these simple tools speak a common language, you can combine them like building blocks, and tackle bigger problems.

Since they're simple

These tools combine like LEGO to build bigger things and tackle bigger problems. When a part stops working, you can swap it with another, or even create your own.

Speakers are a good example. They outlive most devices that connect to it, at least [until you connect them to the cloud](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/01/23/sonos-depracates-legacy-devices-no-updates/).

Televisions are another example, [until you connect them to the cloud](https://www.businessinsider.com/smart-tvs-becoming-obsolete-roku-apple-tv-chromecast-2019-11).

When these tools are deprecated, you just swap them. They're interchangeable, so long as they speak a common language.

If you work with computers, this might not be new to you.
