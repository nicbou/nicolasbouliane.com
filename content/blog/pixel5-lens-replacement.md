Last November, I bumped into a shelf and my Pixel 5 took the impact. The camera lens cracked, and I had to replace it. Here's how I did it.

## The replacement lens

I ordered an [Aocarmo camera lens replacement](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005002449381658.html) from AliExpress. It cost less than 5â‚¬ and arrived about 2 weeks later. As far as I know, there are no other replacement parts.

**This replacement lens is made of plastic, not glass**. Once installed, it looks exactly like the original.

## Replacing the lens

This is a very easy job. Anyone can do it. It takes about 15 minutes. Someone else made [a video of the process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKGTJ6o19Dk).

You need these tools:

- A [replacement lens](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005002449381658.html)
- A razor blade or an Exacto knife to remove the old lens
- A hair dryer to warm up the lens (optional)
- Packing tape or masking tape to remove debris from the lens

Here's how it's done:

1. Heat the lens with the hair dryer. Your phone might turn off because it's too hot. You only need to heat it for about 20 seconds.
2. Use the razor blade to remove the old lens. It will come off bit by bit. Be careful not to scratch the cameras under the lens.
3. Scrape the residue from behind the lens. You can use a bit of tape to lift off the remaining residues.
4. Peel off the sticker from behind the lens, and put it in place. Push the lens down for a few seconds.
5. Peel off the protective film from the other side of the cover.
6. Test the camera to make sure everything works.

That's it!
