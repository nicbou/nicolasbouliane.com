If you are using a password-protected proxy with Package Control, you might have trouble listing new packages.

To solve this problem, set your proxy settings under `Preferences > Package settings > Package Control > Settings - Default`.

Change the `proxy_username` and `proxy_password` setting to those your proxy uses, and you will be good to go!
