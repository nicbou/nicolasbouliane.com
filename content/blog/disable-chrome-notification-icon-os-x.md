In a recent Chrome update, a new bell icon popped up in the OS X notification bar. You can disable this icon in 3 easy steps:

1. Open `chrome://flags`
2. Disable "Enable Rich Notifications"
3. Restart Chrome

It's gone!

**May 2014 update:** It's now called "Notification Center behavior", and you must set it to "Never show"

There is also a very interesting flag, "Tab Overview", that lets you swipe down to see your tabs like in Expose.
