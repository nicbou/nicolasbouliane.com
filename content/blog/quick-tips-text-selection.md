Here are some quick tips regarding text selection. These don't really fit in any category, but can help any coder.

**Double click** then drag around to select entire words instead of individual letters. The keyboard equivalent is Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right when your cursor is placed on a line of text. **Triple-clicking** and dragging usually selects paragraphs.

You can drag and drop selected text on almost all operating systems to cut and paste it around.
