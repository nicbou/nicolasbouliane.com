Some time ago, I fell in love with Amber Case's concept of [calm tech](https://calmtech.com/): technology that requires the smallest possible amount of attention.

Amber spoke of calm tech in the context of design. Calm technology can inform without overburdening, communicate without interrupting, and create ambient awareness through all senses.

These are great principles, but Amber missed an important aspect: calm requires trust. Tech you can't trust is not calm; it's just quiet.

I suggest a different set of rules for calm tech:

1. Only serve the user's interests
2. Require as little attention as possible
3. Use resources sparingly
4. Do not keep secrets from the user
5. Keep the user in control
