Some time ago, I fell in love with Amber Case's concept of [calm tech](https://calmtech.com/): technology that requires the smallest possible amount of attention.

Amber spoke of calm tech in the context of interaction design: calm technology can inform without overburdening, communicate without interrupting, and create ambient awareness through all senses.

These are great principles, but an important aspect is missing: calm requires trust. Tech you can't trust is not calm; it's just silent.

I suggest a different set of rules for calm tech:

1. **Only act in the user's best interests**
    1. Make recommendations that benefit the user, not third parties.
2. **Require as little attention as possible**
    1. A person's primary task should not be computing, but being human.
    2. Inform without overburdening.
3. **Do not keep secrets from the user**
    1. Only use information in ways the user intends.
    2. Do not deceive, mislead or lie to the user.
4. **Keep the user in control**
    1. Let the user choose how their own way of doing things
    1. Advise, but do not demand. The user has the final say.
    2. Get active, informed consent, and respect the user's decision.
    3. Do not hold the user's data hostage.
5. **Operate safely without supervision**
    1. Automated actions should respect the user's intent.
    2. Failures should call for the user's attention.
