Some time ago, I fell in love with Amber Case's concept of [calm tech](https://calmtech.com/): technology that requires the smallest possible amount of attention.

Amber spoke of calm tech in the context of interaction design: calm technology can inform without overburdening, communicate without interrupting, and create ambient awareness through all senses. I fell in love with those principles; they shaped my design philosophy.

But an important aspect is missing: calm requires trust. If you can't trust your software and your devices to be on your side, they are not calm; they are just silent, like predators.

I suggest a different set of rules for calm tech:

1. **Only act in the user's best interests**
    1. Make recommendations that benefit the user, not third parties.
2. **Require as little attention as possible**
    1. A person's primary task should not be computing, but being human.
    2. Inform without overburdening.
3. **Be honest with the user**
    1. Only use data in ways the user intends.
    2. Do not deceive, mislead or lie to the user.
4. **Keep the user in control**
    1. Get active, informed consent, and respect the user's decision.
    2. Let the user have the final say. Ask or suggest, but never demand.
    3. Do not hold data hostage.
5. **Operate safely without supervision**
    1. Automated actions should respect the user's intent.
    2. Errors should call for the user's attention.
