I'm leaving this information here because it's surprisingly difficult to get a straight answer on the modern internet. This information comes directly from the official manual (MR-325).

- Wheel bolts / Lug nuts: 90 Nm
- Front axle hub nuts: 280 Nm
- Rear axle hub nuts: 175 Nm
- Brake caliper guide bolts: 40 Nm
- Brake caliper mounting bolts: 100 Nm
- Disk brake bolts: 20 Nm (9 Nm [according to Autodoc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfUcTNlWKZw))
