Between February and April 2024, I have cycled from Singapore to Phuket, Thailand. I spent most of that time in Malaysia. This post is for those who a similar trip. It's not a travel diary.

## The landscape

If you ride on the West coast - that's where most cities are - you spend most of your time looking at palm oil plantations and rice paddies. The main road is lined with businesses and open-air restaurants. The secondary roads give you a better glimpse of village life.

Although you follow the coastline, you won't see the sea much. It's usually hidden behind 50 metres of mangroves or palm trees. In any case, the water is too muddy to swim in. You will find beaches on islands like Pangkor and Penang.

## The road

The road is completely flat most of the time.

A national route lines the sea across the entire country. There is usually a wide paved shoulder where you can ride safely. However, the heavy traffic is very loud and kicks up a lot of dust. You quickly grow to loathe the time you spend on that road.

The secondary roads are a lot more pleasant. Most of them are paved single or double-lane roads with lots of speed bumps. They sent my panniers flying every time, but they forced most of the traffic onto the main road.

There are also gravel service roads, mostly nearest to the sea and across palm oil plantations. You will see packs of monkeys on those roads, as well as cows, giant lizards and occasionally tapirs.

The roads in and out of major cities are *insane*. There is no bicycle infrastructure, and the only way in or out might be the expressway. It's not legal to ride a bike there, and speaking from experience, not advisable.

To get in and out of Kuala Lumpur, I used Grab to book a 6-seater cab. It cost me 120 MYR each way - about 25€. It's a small price to pay for the convenience and for not dying. On the weekends, you can also use the train to get in or out of the city. Intercity bus might also carry your bike for a little kopi money (20 MYR).

## The weather

*Brutal.* In February and March - right after the monsoon - it's 28º to 35ºC with 70% humidity. The heat the hardest part of the trip. Locals will sometimes question your sanity. You will sometimes question your sanity.

Sometimes, you'll be lucky to ride in the shade of palm trees, but for the most part, you're out in the open, getting pounded by the sun.

You have no choice. Drink a lot of water, slather yourself in sunscreen, and just *tough it out*. Proper bicycle clothing also helps a lot.

Fortunately, it rarely rains until the late afternoon. It comes in short, intense showers that are easy to avoid. Even then, getting caught in a downpour is just a minor hassle. It just cools you down and washes your bike.

Between July and September, farmers burn their crops and fill the air with smoke. This might be a bad time to ride, according to a local cyclist.

## The people

Absolutely delightful. The whole lot of them. All the positive small interactions made the trip so much better. This was a pleasant surprise after a very lonely ride across South Korea.

Malaysia felt outstandingly safe. I never had to worry about my safety (except while riding on the expressway), or second-guess anyone's intentions. I could blindly trust everyone I met, and that was great.

Malaysia has a small but vibrant cycling community. I met a few of them on the road and through social media. They are friendly and eager to share knowledge. They kindly took me around Malakka and Kuala Lumpur and kept proffering advice during the rest of my trip. A lot of what you read now comes from them.

## Accommodation

Hotels are plentiful along the main road. Booking.com works just fine here. Accommodation is rarer and more expensive during Chinese New Year, and slightly less so during the school holidays.

There are hostels in larger cities. I have not seen any campgrounds and wouldn't try camping in this weather. You will not need camping gear here.

Most hotels are fine. They can be somewhat old and dingy, but I always had a comfortable bed, air conditioning and good Wi-Fi.

## Food and drink

On the main road, you are always 5 to 20 minutes from a hot meal and a cold drink. Even the smallest village will have a *warung*. You don't need to pack lunch or even snacks. Vegetarian food might be really hard to come by.

You just need water. Lots of water. You can drink the tap water in Malaysia, and every restaurant has a sink where you can wash your hands, wipe the grime off your face and refill your bottle. Most of them serve iced drinks.

Few hotels include breakfast, but there's always a kopitiam nearby where you can fill up before the ride.

## The route

The West coast is the more sensible route, as it crosses most of the big cities and important sights. The monsoon ends later on the East coast.

I regret going to Johor Bahru, and wish I'd [crossed the border further East](/blog/singapore-malaysia-border-bicycle). My hotel was trapped between two expressways, and leaving the city involved a reckless ride on the expressway.

I chose to skip Cameron Highland. I didn't feel like climbing 1,500 metres up along Malaysia's longest traffic jam. Quite a few people report that it's a pretty underwhelming destination.

## Practical details

### Flying with a bike

Flying with the bike is a pain. Most airlines have labyrinthine luggage policies that even they can't figure out when asked.

Finnair is the only airline with a clear price for bikes, but it's not a cheap airline. Besides, they pummelled my bike box like it owed them money. When my bike came out on the conveyor belt, the box was torn open with the wheel hanging loose. My heart stopped, but nothing fell out or got damaged.

Scoot is a much cheaper option. They let you check in a bike as part of your luggage allowance, so no extra charge so long as you're within the weight limit. At least that's what Redditors told me. Their customer support refused to tell me how much it cost to ship a bike, insisting that I'd know when I check in.

### Tech

You get solid phone reception almost everywhere, so you can rely on mobile data. I got a SIM card from Nomad before leaving, so I had internet as soon as I arrived in Singapore.

I use OsmAnd to get detailed offline maps, and Google Maps with satellite view to guess road quality. Both maps were fairly accurate. I was never led astray by bad maps.

Whatsapp is very common here. Hotels sometimes assume that they can contact you that way. So do most people. It's good to have.

### Bicycle gear

There are *some* bicycle shops along the route, although I did not check them out. I'd advise carrying your own tools and some spare tubes.

I strongly recommend getting a hiplock. I use it all the time to lock my bike and panniers while I pop into a store or stop for lunch.

### Working on the road

Malaysia did not have a lot of infrastructure for digital nomads. It's rather hard to find a desk to work at, or even a friendly coffee shop. Most restaurants and coffee shops here are open-air. Nice air-conditioned hipster cafés with laptop tables are a rarity.

On the bright side, all but one hotel had fast Wi-Fi.
