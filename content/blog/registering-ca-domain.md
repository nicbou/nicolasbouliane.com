If you read this, then you are probably trying to register a .ca domain and wondering what the heck is wrong with your organization name. Every time I try to register a .ca, I end up with `Organization name is invalid` or `Valid CIRA word required`. I try using my full name, my initials, anything, but it simply never works and I end up googling it.

Here's the deal: you need to add a business type at the end of your business name. For example, *Lt√©e*, *Ltd*, *Inc* and *Corp* will work.

Having similar issues? Post them below and I will document the solutions you have found.
