I had drinks with a Spaniard in Malaysia. He moved to Malakka years ago to start a tapas restaurant with his wife. As we sat by the street, watching the humid air condense on our beer glasses, we started talking about the logistics of running a restaurant there. He described the the difficulty of hiring and training the local staff to his foreign standard.

He struggled with the Nepalese migrant workers that made up half of his staff. These boys, he explained, were dropped at the airport by their agency and left to fend for themselves.

When they had problems with money or health, with loneliness or the family back home, they'd turn to him and his wife. He was unexpectedly thrust into the role of a father figure for half a dozen boys. He truly had to run the business like a family, with all the drama it involved.

More interestingly, unlike the Nepalese, he continued, the Muslim migrant workers fared much better. When they arrived in Malakka, the local mosque would soften their landing. There, they could find community, a place to spend time, and people to help them. They had a support network. The Nepalese workers did not.

I [help immigrants for a living](/projects/all-about-berlin). I am keenly aware of how it feels to move somewhere without a support network. Yet I was completely oblivious to the oldest support network in the world: religion. I could talk somebody's head off about third places and social infrastructure, but it never occurred to me that mosques could be examples to learn from.
