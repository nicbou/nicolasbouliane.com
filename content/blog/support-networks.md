When I was in Malaysia, I shared a meal with a Spanish restaurateur. He had been running a tapas restaurant in Malakka for the better part of a decade.

We mostly talked about bicycles, but also delved into the logistics of running a tapas restaurant halfway around the world. He told me about the difficulty of hiring and training restaurant staff in Malaysia.

One point that struck me was the problems he faced with the Nepalese migrant workers that made up half of his staff. These boys, he explained, were dropped at the airport by their agency and left to fend for themselves. When they had a problem - money, sickness, even teenage angst - they turned to their boss, the only person they know. He was unexpectedly thrust into the role of a father figure for half a dozen boys. 

His Muslim employees, on the other hand, could count on the local mosque to soften their landing. The mosque would set them up, show them around and be there when they needed help. Muslims had a support network. The Nepalese boys did not.

I earn a living from giving immigrants a soft landing. I started by giving them good information. The next logical step is to give them a community.

Yet I was completely oblivious to the oldest support networks in the world. I could talk somebody's head off about third places and social infrastructure, but I never considered the mosque or the YMCA as examples to learn from.
