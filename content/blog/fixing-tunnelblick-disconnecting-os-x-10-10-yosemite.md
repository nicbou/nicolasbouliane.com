If you have just upgraded to Yosemite, you might have run into issues with Tunnelblick. First, it will connect properly, then disconnect immediately after.

To fix this, open the Tunnelblick connection settings, click "Advanced settings" and uncheck "Flush DNS cache after connecting or disconnecting".
