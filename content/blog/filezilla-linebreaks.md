Occasionally, you might run into various line break issues with FileZilla. For instance, you might have double line breaks instead or no line breaks at all.

To fix this issue, change the transfer type to binary by going in *Menu*, *Transfer type*, *Binary*. Your line breaks should now work properly in your text editor of choice.
