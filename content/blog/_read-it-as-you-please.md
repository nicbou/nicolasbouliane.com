For the most part, the content I create is just text on a page.

You can read it on any screen you like. You can use your browser's reader mode. You read it later in Pocket or Instapaper. You can even print it.

If your eyes struggle, you can zoom in. It won't break the layout. If you have a disability, you can have device read it for you.

In any case, the content won't look much different. It might be missing the widgets I built to explain things, but I account for that. The content repeats the same information, just slower.

If the website goes down, you might read it on archive.org. I built the pages to be archivable.

This only required me to do *nothing whatsoever*. It's just text on a page.
