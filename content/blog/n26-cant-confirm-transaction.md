title: N26 bug: can't confirm transactions
description: Sometimes the N26 app won't let you confirm a transaction. Here's what to do.

When you make a SEPA transfer or a standing order with N26, you must confirm the transaction in the app. Sometimes, that doesn't work. The "Tap to confirm or cancel" (*Hier klicken um das anzunehmen oder abzulehnen*) button appears, but when you click it, nothing happens. [This YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLSlyu38PXo) shows the problem.

This issue has been happening for *years*. This is happening on my Samsung S9, but it happens on other devices too. There are hundreds of reports about this issue[^0].

Fixes that did not work for me:

- Restarting the app
- Restarting the phone
- Unpairing and repairing the app (under Settings > Security)
- Reinstalling the app
- Switching from Wi-Fi to mobile
- Turning off power-saving features for the N26 app
- Creating a new transaction on the N26 website

In the end, I recreated the same transaction directly in the N26 app, instead of using the website. I was able to confirm this one. There are still two "stuck" transactions, but at least I was able to send money.

The long term solution is to switch to [another bank](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/best-bank-germany). N26 hasn't fixed this issue in over 3 years. I don't expect them to fix it anytime soon. If you don't insist on English language support, DKB and ING are solid alternatives.
