Since a recent Chrome update, a new bell icon popped up in the Windows task bar. I have recently posted an article showing you how to disable it in OS X, and it turns out the steps are the same for Windows users. You can disable this notification icon in 3 easy steps:

1. Open `chrome://flags`
2. Disable "Enable Rich Notifications"
3. Restart Chrome

The notification icon should now be absent from your notification area. Did that work for you? Confirm with the other users in the comments.
