In September 2021, I covered the road in Romania, between Corbi and the Vidraru dam on the the Transfăgărășan.

This road is not paved, and rather bumpy. It's not a challenging road for off-road enthusiasts. A passenger car can handle it, but you might need a bit of ground clearance. There was very little mud. I don't think that mud would be a problem, as the surface is very rocky. There are bears in the area. As soon as I arrived on the Transfăgărășan, I saw bears on the side of the road.

The road is mostly unused. I came across 3 vehicles and 1 friendly motorcyclist named Tudor. I think that parts of the trail have mobile reception.

There are a few nice views along the route. Most of it is a lush coniferous forest, but the northern part also gives on large plains. It's a rather nice route.

When you leave the trail, you can continue northwards to see the lake, or southwards to see the best part of the Transfăgărășan, Romania's most famous road.
