I wanted to buy a bicycle to ride from Seoul to Busan, and onward to Japan. Since I was not returning to Seoul, renting from [Green Cycle Park](https://www.greencyclepark.com/) was not possible.

I was hoping to find a cheap used bike. I did not intend to keep it, so a new bike would have been expensive and wasteful.

If you are in a similar situation, here are a few things you should know. **If you just want a list of stores, it's at the bottom.**

## The Seoul bicycle culture

Seoul has a vibrant cycling community, but it's almost exclusively riding expensive road bikes and the occasional mountain bike. There is little love for touring bikes, and you don't see many bike commuters. I saw very few bikes with fenders or pannier racks.

There are some people commuting on old budget mountain bikes, and you will see them scattered around. Others use Seoul Bike, the city's absurdly cheap bike rental scheme.

There are English and Korean-speaking communities. Among them are [Dossa](https://corearoadbike.com/) and [Han River Riders Cycling](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HanRiverRiders). I owe the latter a debt of gratitude for helping me find a bike.

## The Seoul bicycle infrastructure

There are bike paths in Seoul, but they seem mostly for leisure. There are bike paths on both sides the Han River. Elsewhere, they are few and far between. A few arteries have narrow bike paths. Cyclists usually share the broad sidewalks with pedestrians.

## Where to buy a (used) bicycle

Start with [this article](https://www.expatguidekorea.com/article/buying-a-bike-in-seoul-as-an-english-speaker.html) from expatguidekorea.com. It's written by an actual human who tried to buy a bicycle. I am merely adding to that post.

This is where I found decent bikes:

- [Korea Bicycle Market](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1925380707494620), [Bicycle Buy and Sale Korea](https://www.facebook.com/groups/287295429283819) (mostly spam) and [Bicycle Classifieds Seoul](https://www.facebook.com/groups/BicycleClassifiedsSeoul/)
- [Dossa](https://corearoadbike.com/). A Korean-speaking bike community with a [market section](https://corearoadbike.com/board/board.php?t_id=Menu02Top1).
- [Dongmyo flea market](https://goo.gl/maps/vsYf8zCFU9QW9qBh8) has some used bikes, and some new. When I visited, the used bikes were in really poor condition.
- [Craigslist](https://seoul.craigslist.org/search/bia) has a dozen bikes.
- [Wright Brothers](https://wrightbrothers.kr). A well-known bike store. They have English-speaking staff, and they sell new and used bikes. The used-bikes are fairly priced, but they are not so cheap.
- [Bikely](https://goo.gl/maps/2r5VZVSqPVjLb7ay8) does not sell used bikes, but they are the only store I found that carries touring bikes, panniers, and other touring accessories.
