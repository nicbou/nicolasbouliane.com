Using the 16 mm spark plug socket, install the new spark plug. Do not over-torque the new spark plug.

Reinsert the ignition coil, and bolt it back in place. Do not over-torque the bolt, or you will strip the aluminium threads that hold it in place.

Reconnect the wire to the ignition coil.

Repeat for all 4 spark plugs.
