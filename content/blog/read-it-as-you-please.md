For the most part, the content I create is just text on a page.

You can read it on any screen you like. You can use your browser's reader mode. You read it later in Pocket or Instapaper. You can even print it if that's how you roll.

If your eyes struggle, zoom in. It won't distort the page layout. If you have a disability, let screen reader read it to you. It's built for them too.

In any case, the content won't look much different. It might be missing the widgets and calculators I built to explain things, but I account for that. The content repeats the same information, only with more words.

If the website goes down, get it from archive.org. The pages are built to keep working on their own, even if the rest of the website vanishes.

Information wants to be free. The medium through which it's consumed should be as permissive as possible.
