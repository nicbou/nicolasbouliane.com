If I linked you to this page, it's because I can't help you.

Let's try again.

## What are you trying to do?

What problem do you want to solve?

Tell me what you're actually trying to do, not just where you got stuck. Sometimes, there is a better way to do things. We can avoid an [XY problem](https://xyproblem.info/).

> **Bad:** "Help I urgently need a tax ID!"

> **Good:** "My new employer asks for a tax ID, but I don't have one yet. Can I start my new job anyway?"

## What is the problem?

Where are you stuck? What is blocking you? What errors did you get? What are the exact symptoms of the problem?

Tell me exactly what's wrong. It's a lot faster if you give me the information I need to help you.

> **Good:** "My 2009 Ford Focus won't start. When I turn the key, the dash lights come on, and the radio starts, but the engine does not turn at all."

> **Not good:** "Help my email is not working"

## What is your situation?

Give me enough information to help you.

If you ask me about German immigration, tell me where you come from, where you currently live, and what your visa situation is.

> **Good:** “I am a Nigerian citizen and I currently live in Hungary. I have a university degree in software engineering. Can I get a German work visa?”

> **Not good:** “Help how do I move to Germany?"

## What have you tried so far?

Give me enough information to diagnose your problem.

What have you already done to solve your problem? Have you searched for existing solutions? Have you tried any of the solutions? What happened?

If you tell me what did *not* work, we save a lot of time. I can understand the problem better, and offer more specific help.

> **Good:** "What residence permit options do I have? I can't get a work visa or a Blue Card because I don't have vocational training. Can I move to Germany as a student, or do an internship there instead?"

> **Not good:** "What should I see and do in Berlin"

## Remember the human

I will help you *for free*, but I ask for 3 things in return:

- **Make an effort.** I can't do all the work for you. I won't spend 30 minutes to save you 30 seconds of research.
- **Be reasonable.** I help people for free as a courtesy. If you need a personal consultation or comprehensive support, please hire someone.
- **Be kind.** Say hello, please and thank you. I am a stranger who helps you for free, not a chatbot. Don't be like [Liam](/images/rude-email.png).
