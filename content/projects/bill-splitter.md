Bill Splitter was a tool I threw together in less than a day to manage shared expenses with my roommates. It did its job elegantly for a while. I left this project aside after getting my own apartment, but it still remained online to the delight of a dozen people for a few years.

The backend was built with Django. The frontend was built with Bootstrap. Nothing fancy.
