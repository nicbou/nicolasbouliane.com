My very first application was a random facts app for Palm OS. It was written in BASIC. I remember copying the facts by hand from the internet. I believe that the graphics were made in Microsoft Paint, pixel by pixel. I released half a dozen extensions with quotes from TV shows, among others.

I thought it was lost until I found an archived version on [MobyWare](https://www.mobyware.org/palm-os/encyclopedia-facts-tag/random-facts-download-118089.html). It was the 5th most popular download (with 48 downloads). I nearly fell off my chair when I saw that I could download the full app *with the source code*.
