If you travel far enough, you will find places that mark the boundary between a trip and an adventure, and they bear the mark of [every badass](/blog/greater-badass) who was there before you.

Closer to home, the bathroom of your local watering hole hints at the sort of crowd who drinks there. You find pro-Palestine stickers at Cafe Engels, punk stickers at Clash, communist stickers at Kuckucksei, and cryptocurrency stickers at Hops & Barley.

I love how this sort of guerrilla art snaps me out of autopilot, and I wanted to make my own for a while.

Recently, a friend got me into watercolour painting, and we were talking about leaving our watercolours in random places for strangers to take home. Then I made this little doodle that I loved too much to let go. Instead, I put him on a small batch of stickers.

If you find yourself in one of my favourite bars, look out for one of those stickers.
