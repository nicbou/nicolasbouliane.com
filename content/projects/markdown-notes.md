Markdown Notes is a markdown editor with support for LaTeX formulas. I built it in university to simplify writing engineering notes. After university, I stopped maintaining the project, but it still has a number of active users.

Markdown Notes was built with Angular. It has a simple Django backend that handles authentication, note storage and image uploads.

[I took Markdown Notes offline](/blog/goodbye-markdown-notes) in 2020 to reduce my maintenance burden and save the hosting costs. The domain expired and was bought by someone else. It now redirects to a porn site.
