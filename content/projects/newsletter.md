In December 2025, I started [a monthly newsletter](https://allaboutberlin.com/newsletter) for All About Berlin.

*Why a newsletter?* Because the internet has changed. AI-generated answers — ChatGPT and Google’s AI summaries — have halved traffic to All About Berlin. Social media algorithms also downrank posts with external links. It’s getting hard to reach people, and the writing is on the wall for the independent web. It’s time to slowly build an audience of my own, independently from tech giants and their algorithms.

This is also my chance to write to you directly, in my own language, as a friend. After 8 years of writing guides in the simplest, most succinct English, it’s nice to unwind and throw idioms around.

This newsletter will be three things: occasional, casual, and conversational. I want to share interesting updates and timely reminders, and ask for your feedback every once in a while. There will be no ads and no sponsored content.

## Picking the platform

I tried Substack, because it's where all the cool journalists hang, but that platform *creeps me out*. They immediately started spamming my inbox and running me through a gauntlet of growth hacks. I spent the first few hours just turning things off. It's so desperately trying to be a social network while I just want a newsletter publishing tool. I feel like it will take every opportunity to use my audience for its own gain.

Instead, I chose Buttondown, a quiet underdog whose business model I vibe with. The free tier is good enough to get something off the ground.

## Growth

This newsletter is a way for me to share updates with a consenting audience, without meddling from algorithms. It's my way to [work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu), and hopefully to create [social infrastructure](https://maggieappleton.com/gathering-structures) in the future.

I don't intend to compete with excellent newsletters like [Handpicked Berlin](https://handpickedberlin.com/), [20 Percent Berlin](https://www.20percent.berlin/), [Berlin Events Weekly](https://www.berlineventsweekly.com/) and [The Berlin Companion](https://theberlincompanion.com/). I have neither the energy nor the writing chops.

## Other notes

Last year, I [asked the internet](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32304011) why so many websites pushed their newsletter. I was surprised to hear that they worked so well.
