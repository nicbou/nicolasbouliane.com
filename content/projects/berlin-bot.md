Along with [All About Berlin](/projects/all-about-berlin), I created a small bot to answer repetitive questions on [reddit.com/r/berlin](https://www.reddit.com/r/berlin). It directs users to existing answers, and invites them to ask their questions in the right places.

I deactivated the bot in 2020, during the pandemic. The /r/berlin moderators made a few changes to curb the number of tourist posts, and the bot was not needed any more.
