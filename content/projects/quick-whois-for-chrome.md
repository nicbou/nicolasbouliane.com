Some time ago, I built a small Chrome extension that showed the current tab's WHOIS record in a popup. It was a simple, single-purpose extension that worked for a few years. It had a few thousand users, and even some mentions[^0].

 I maintained this extension from 2011 to 2014. Around 2018, it suffered the same fate as my Android apps: death by app store requirements. I stopped keeping up with the Chrome Web Store's annual requirement changes, so the extension eventually disappeared from it.
