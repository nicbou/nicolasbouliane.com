Trly.gd was my first real website. It was not really a website, but a drop-in replacement for the browser's default search engine. It could redirect your queries to the right search engine based on the keywords you used. For example, "images:dog" would search Google Images, "en2fr:dog" would translate words to French, "wen:dog" would search English Wikipedia and so on.

It ran quietly for over a decade, making it my longest-running project. The keywords are engraved in my memory, and I instantly miss them when I use someone else's computer.

When I [rebuilt my website from scratch](/projects/personal-website-v3), I took a few minutes to rewrite [the original script](https://gist.github.com/nicbou/1cf859172710b987d4a2883f5d951aa2) in Python, enable HTTPS, and disable server logs. I should have done that a long time ago.
