I rebuilt my website again. With a simple design, and simple tech.

The previous iteration was over-engineered. Craft CMS was overkill for a blog. It had too many moving parts that demanded too much upkeep.

Now, it's built with [a static site generator I made](/projects/ursus). Ursus swallows [a bunch of markdown files](https://github.com/nicbou/nicolasbouliane.com/tree/master/content) and spits out a static website. I dump the files on a server, and I get a simple, fast, zero-maintenance website. It will run until I stop paying the hosting bill.

I kept the design simple and readable. It's inspired by Maggie Appleton's digital garden, from which it borrows a few colours.

This is just what I needed. It's [calm technology](https://calmtech.com/) that reflects the changes in [my relationship with technology](/blog/silence).
