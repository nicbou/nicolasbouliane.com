I rebuilt my website again. Simple design, simple tech.

The old site was over-engineered. Craft CMS was overkill for a blog. It had too many moving parts that demanded too much upkeep.

Now, it's built with [a static site generator I made](/projects/ursus). It swallows [a bunch of markdown files](https://github.com/nicbou/nicolasbouliane.com/tree/master/content) and spits out a static website. Dump the files on a server, and you get a simple, fast, zero-maintenance website.

This is just what I needed. It's [calm technology](https://calmtech.com/) that reflects the changes in [my relationship with technology](/blog/silence).
