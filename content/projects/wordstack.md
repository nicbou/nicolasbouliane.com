Wordstack is a very simple word game for Android. You are given some letters, and you must find as many words that begin with those letters as possible before the time runs out. Every new word you find gives you extra time. Longer words give you more time.

Wordstack suffered a death by app store requirements. After a few years, I couldn't be bothered to keep up with the Play Store's new demands, and the app disappeared from it.
