Jetpack was a simple application launcher for Android. It just displayed apps as an alphabetical list, nothing fancy.

Like [Wordstack](/projects/wordstack), it suffered death by app store requirements. After a few years, I couldn't be bothered to keep up with the Play Store's new demands, and the app disappeared from it.
