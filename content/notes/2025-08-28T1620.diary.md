I have finally started implemented visual regression testing on All About Berlin. It takes screenshots of elements, and compares them to old ones. If anything changed by even one pixel, I get an error. This helps me catch bugs and unexpected visual changes.

Since I already use Pytest and Playwright, I chose to use [this library](https://github.com/iloveitaly/pytest-playwright-visual-snapshot/).
