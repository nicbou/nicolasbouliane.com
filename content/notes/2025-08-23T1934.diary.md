It's time to bite the bullet and clear some technical debt. [All About Berlin](/projects/all-about-berlin) has unit tests, but they're run manually, and some of them are a pain to update. As the website's [tools](https://allaboutberlin.com/tools) grow in complexity, manual testing is quickly becoming unsustainable. A change in the health insurance calculator logic might break the tax calculator, and I won't notice until someone complains.

This cowboy coder has yee'd his last haw, and started rewriting his tests to be easier to understand and easier to update. The goal is to iterate towards a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. Pretty fancy for a blog!
