Three concepts I bring up often:

- **TV-buying problem:** A product category where all options look the same, none of the features make sense, and all of the specs are misleading. You pretty much need an expert to pick for you. Televisions, smartphones and health insurance are such products.
- **Ryanair check in experience:** A process that involves repeatedly refusing to buy things, give up personal data, or sign up for marketing spam.
- **The 'Ist' and the 'Soll':** How things should be on paper, and how they are in reality. It's the difference between having rights, and being able to effectively enforce them.
