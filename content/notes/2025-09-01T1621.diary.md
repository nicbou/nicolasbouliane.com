A few of the things I enjoyed reading recently:

- Everything from [Prickly Oxheart](https://prickly.oxhe.art/blog), but particularly *[Who are you without the next thing to do?](https://prickly.oxhe.art/empty-space/)*, *[Do nothing](https://prickly.oxhe.art/nothingness/)* and *[What if this is it?](https://prickly.oxhe.art/this-is-it/)*
- [The whispering earring](https://croissanthology.com/earring). A prescient cautionary tale.
- [Speak White](https://dormirajamais.org/speak-white/) by Mich√®le Lalonde recently resurfaced in conversation
- [When we get Komooted](https://bikepacking.com/plog/when-we-get-komooted/). When a community that you have built sells out to venture capital.
- Everything from [Experimental History](https://www.experimental-history.com/). It's hard to pick a favourite after reading a dozen posts back to back.
- [The symbol of earthly good, and the immediate object of toil.](https://crookedtimber.org/2025/06/23/the-symbol-of-earthly-good-and-the-immediate-object-of-toil/)
