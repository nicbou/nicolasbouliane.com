> "When I'm working on an essay, I spend far more time reading than writing. I'll reread some parts 50 or 100 times, replaying the thoughts in them and asking myself, like someone sanding a piece of wood, does anything catch? Does anything feel wrong? And the easier the essay is to read, the easier it is to notice if something catches."

"Sanding" is a great metaphor for the work I do. The same content, revised again and again over many years. This morning, I am revising my [health insurance guide](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/german-health-insurance) once again. I am applying new insights from dozens of reddit threads and hundreds of reader questions. I have found a more straightforward way to explain things, small details I had not mentioned yet.
