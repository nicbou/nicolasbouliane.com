If you are an adult, and you have a problem with an organisation, your first steps should be:

1. Read the messages you have received from that organisation
2. Read the contract you have signed with that organisation
3. Contact the organisation's customer service
4. Search the internet for existing answers
5. Ask the community

People often go straight for step 5, and I find that disrespectful of other people's time.
