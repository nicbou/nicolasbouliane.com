## Ingredients

- 1 aubergine, diced in 2 cm cubes
- 1 zucchini, diced in 2 cm cubes
- 1 red onion, diced
- 2 stalks celery, cut in 2 cm chunks
- 150 g tomatoes, or 1 large tomato
- 150 ml tomato purée
- 40 g green olives, halved
- 40 g raisins
- 40 g almonds, toasted and salted
- 30 g capers
- 1 tbsp dark chocolate, grated
- 75 ml red wine vinegar
- 200 ml sunflower oil, or vegetable oil
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1 tbsp sugar
- Salt
- Bread, to serve

## Preparation

1. Dice the **aubergine** and the **zucchini** in 2 cm cubes, lightly salt, then leave to rest in a colander for 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, heat **sunflower oil** in a pan. You need enough oil to fry the vegetables. It should be hot enough to instantly brown a breadcrumb.
3. Fry the aubergine and zucchini in batches until golden. Let the oil get hot again between batches. Let the fried cubes dry on paper towels or table clothes.
4. In a separate pot, brown the **onion** and **celery** in **olive oil** with a pinch of **salt**.
5. When the onion and celery begin to colour, add **red pepper flakes**. Fry for another minute.
6. Add **tomatoes** and fry for an extra 3 minutes.
7. Stir in the **capers**, **olives**, **raisins**, **sugar**, **tomato purée**, **red wine vinegar** and **chocolate**.
8. Bring to a boil, then add the fried aubergine and zucchini.
9. Season with salt, turn heat down, cover, and leave to simmer for 1 hour.
10. Let the caponata cool to room temperature, then season again as needed.
11. Serve cold with fresh bread.

This recipe is adapted from [The Guardian's caponata recipe](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/29/how-to-cook-perfect-caponata-felicity-cloake). After a few iterations, I believe I got the right mix.

A few notes about this recipe:

- This caponata is slightly spicy, but not hot.
- Sunflower oil is totally worth the extra expense.
