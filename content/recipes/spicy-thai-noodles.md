## Ingredients

- 250 g linguine
- 1 large carrot, grated
- 2 spring onions, chopped
- 1 bunch cilantro, or around 15 g, roughly chopped
- 80 g salted peanuts, crushed
- 6 tbsp sesame oil
- 3 tbsp honey
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 0.5 tbsp chilli flakes

## Preparation

1. Boil the **pasta** with a tablespoon of **salt**.
2. While the pasta cooks, grate the **carrot**, chop one or two **green onions**, and enough **cilantro** to top the dish. Crush some **peanuts** to sprinkle on top.
3. Put 6 tbsp of **sesame oil**, and 1/2 tbsp **chili flakes** in a sauce pan on low heat for around 5 minutes.
4. Add 3 tbsp **honey** and 4 tbsp **soy sauce** to the pan, and turn the heat way down.
5. When the pasta is ready, mix it with the sauce. Top with carrots, cilantro, green onions and crushed peanuts.

I have made that recipe countless times, and learned a few lessons:

- Too many green onions will ruin this dish, but you can use a *lot* of cilantro.
- Crushing the peanuts is worth the extra effort. It helps them mix with the pasta instead of slipping off your fork.
- If your guests like spicy food, don't be afraid to use more chili flakes. 1/2 tbsp is the sweet spot for delicate European palates, but you can double that amount.
