## Ingredients

- 400 ml maple syrup
- 400 ml cream
- 225 g flour, all purpose (North America) or Type 550 (Germany)
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 pinch salt
- 115 g butter
- 210 g sugar
- 2 eggs
- 200 ml milk
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Preparation

This is a traditional dessert in the province of Quebec, and a personal favourite of mine. It's a cake baked in equal parts maple syrup and cream. An absolute sin.

1. Preheat the oven to 200ºC
2. In one bowl, mix the **flour**, **salt** and **baking powder**.
3. In another bowl, mix the **sugar** and **butter** into a cream with an electric mixer. Add the **eggs** one by one.
4. Slowly add the **milk** and dry ingredients to the second bowl. Add a bit of milk, then a bit of the dry ingredients until everything is blended in.
5. Boil the **maple syrup** and **cream** together.
6. With a wooden spoon, add lumps of batter to the boiling syrup. Do not mix them.
7. Bake for about 40 minutes. Bake until you can jab the cake with a toothpick and it comes out clean.

This recipe is based on [Ricardo's recipe](https://www.ricardocuisine.com/recettes/5411-pouding-chomeur-au-sirop-d-erable). It tastes exactly as it should. I use a little syrup and cream because the cake doesn't need so much sauce.
