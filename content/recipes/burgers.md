## Ingredients

- 1 burger bun, lightly buttered
- 110 g minced beef, per patty
- 1 pinch Kosher salt, per patty
- Pepper

## Preparation

This is how you make delicious slim, juicy pan burgers. With a scale and a timer, they turn out perfect every time.

1. Form 110 gram minced beef balls, slightly flatten them, and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.
2. Heat the cooking oil in a pan, on medium-high heat. The meat should sizzle as soon as it hits the pan.
3. First, lightly toast the buns on all sides, and remove from pan.
4. Put the patties on the pan, and flatten them with a flat spatula or the bottom of a pot. Press them down hard for 10 good seconds.
5. Cook the patties for 55 seconds on each side. If you have cheese, throw it on top of the patty while the second side cooks.
6. Serve the burgers however you like them. I like the classic mayo, mustard, cheddar, tomato and lettuce.

Personally, I'm not a big fan of hockey puck-sized patties. I like patties that are thick enough to be juicy, but still leave room for other flavours. If you want more meat, you can always stack two patties.

If you want proper smashed burgers, make 90 gram patties, and cook them for 45 seconds on each side.
