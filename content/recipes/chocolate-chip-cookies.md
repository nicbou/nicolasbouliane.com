## Ingredients

- 100 g butter, at room temperature
- 125 g powdered sugar
- 1 egg
- 0.5 tsp vanilla extract
- 200 g flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- A pinch of salt
- 100 g dark chocolate

## Preparation

1. Beat **softened butter** and **caster's sugar** until fine and creamy.
2. Add **egg** and **vanilla**, mix well.
3. Slowly whisk in **flour**, **salt** and **baking powder**.
4. Add **chocolate chips**.
5. Roll 12 tablespoon-sized dough balls, put in the fridge for 15 minutes. If you're in a hurry, you can skip this step.
6. Meanwhile, preheat oven at 170ºC (no fan)
7. Slightly flatten the dough balls with your finger, place on a tray
8. Bake at 170ºC for 12 minutes. Don't wait until the cookies are browned. The cookies are puffy to the touch when they come out. They're fine. Let them cool down for a bit.

This recipe was shamelessly stolen from [Jamie Oliver's website](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/chocolate-recipes/chocolate-chip-cookies/). I replaced self-raising flour with regular flour and baking powder.
