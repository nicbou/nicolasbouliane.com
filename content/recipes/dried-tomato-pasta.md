This is my standard oh-damn-it's-Sunday-and-I-didn't-buy-food dish. It only requires pantry ingredients, and optionally parsley from the balcony garden.

The original recipe (with pictures) is [here](https://www.lastingredient.com/sun-dried-tomato-pasta/).

## Ingredients

- 250 g penne
- Olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic
- 220 g dried tomatoes, drained and chopped
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes
- 1 pinch to 1 tsp salt
- black pepper to taste
- Parmesan to taste
- 1 cup rocket (optional)
- 1 tbsp chopped parsley, for serving

## Preparation

1. Start cooking the penne in salted water.
2. Heat olive oil in a pan.
3. When the pasta is about halfway done, cook the **garlic** in olive oil for about 30 seconds
4. Add the **dried tomatoes**, **red pepper flakes**, **salt** and **pepper**. Cook for another 2 minutes
5. Stir the pasta into the tomatoes, saving some pasta water.
6. Stir a little pasta water into the mix.
7. Add the parmesan and rocket
8. Garnish with parsley
