## Ingredients

- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1.5 tbsp paprika
- 2 tsp cumin
- 800 g peeled tomatoes, in their juice, crushed to smaller bits
- 1 tsp salt, adjust to taste
- pepper
- 1 bunch cilantro, half for cooking, half for serving
- 5 eggs, at room temperature
- feta cheese, to taste, for serving
- Kalamata olives, to taste, for serving

## Preparation

1. Cook the **red bell pepper** in **olive oil** in a pan on medium heat. Lightly char the peppers, then add the **onion**. Cook until the it softens.
2. Add the **garlic** and cook for about 30 seconds. At that point your pan shouldn't be too hot, so it won't burn the garlic.
3. Add the **paprika** and **cumin**. Mix until everything is coated with them.
4. Crush the **tomatoes** between your fingers to make them smaller. Add them to the pan.
5. Add **salt**, **pepper** and half of the **cilantro**. Simmer on low temperature for around 10 minutes. Adjust salt and pepper to taste while it cooks. I use about 1 teaspoon of salt.
6. Make little wells in the sauce for **eggs**. Pour the eggs into those holes. If the eggs are at room temperature, they cook faster and the yolk doesn't harden.
7. Let everything simmer until the eggs are cooked.
8. Sprinkle with **feta**, **olives**, and the rest of the **cilantro**. Serve with bread.
