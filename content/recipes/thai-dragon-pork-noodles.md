## Ingredients

- 80 g Sriracha chilli garlic sauce, or 65 millilitres
- 90 g soy sauce, or 65 millilitres
- 70 g brown sugar, or 65 millilitres
- 250 g minced pork, or mixed pork and beef
- 2 stalks spring onions
- A handful of peanuts, crushed
- 250 g ramen noodles

## Preparation

1. Mix **Sriracha sauce**, **soy sauce** and **brown sugar** together
2. Brown the **pork**
3. Add **peanuts** and sauce mix to pork. Let it heat until it reduces by half.
4. Boil the **ramen noodles**. You can finish cooking them in the sauce.
5. Mix the noodles with the sauce
6. Top with **green onions** and serve

I have made this recipe a few times, because it's quick and doesn't require many fresh ingredients (only pork, and optional green onions). This is based on [Budget Byte's recipe](https://www.budgetbytes.com/pork-peanut-dragon-noodles/), and adapted to the metric system and German portion sizes.

I have learned a few tricks while making this:

- Let the pan get really hot before adding the pork. You want the meat to brown, not just boil in its fat.
- Don't let the pork clump together. Smaller bits mix better with the sauce and the pasta.
- Crush the peanuts so that they mix with the pasta instead of slipping off your fork.
- It's easier to measure by weight than by volume. You can throw everything into the same bowl.
