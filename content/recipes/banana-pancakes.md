## Ingredients

- 125 g flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 0.5 tsp salt
- 1 banana, over-ripe, mashed
- 250 ml milk
- 2 eggs
- 3 tbsp butter, melted, plus more for cooking
- 0.5 tsp vanilla extract

## Preparation

1. Whisk together the **flour**, **sugar**, **baking powder** and **salt**.
2. In a separate bowl, melt the **butter**, then beat in the **eggs**, **milk**, **vanilla** and **banana**.
3. *Gently* mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Just turn it a few times with a spoon. The batter should stay thick and lumpy.
4. Butter a hot pan, and cook pancakes in batches of two. Flip the pancakes once you can lift them with the spatula. The top will still be runny, but the bottom will be browned.
5. Serve with maple syrup, obviously.

Notes about this recipe:

- It makes 6 pancakes in total. That's enough to feed 2 or 3 people.
- Over-ripe bananas taste noticeably better, but you can also use ripe bananas.
- Banana chunks taste better than mashed bananas.
