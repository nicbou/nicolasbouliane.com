## Ingredients

- 500 g gnocchi
- 70 g pesto verde, or 2-3 spoonfuls
- 80 ml passata (optional)
- 1 pinch salt
- pepper, to taste
- olive oil

## Preparation

1. Heat the **olive oil** in a pan on medium heat.
3. Add the **gnocchi** to the hot pan, and cook for 1 or 2 minutes, until golden.
4. Add the **pesto verde**, and a pinch of **salt**. Cook for 1 or 2 minutes.
5. (optional) Add the **passata** and **pepper**. Cook until the sauce reduces and sticks to the gnocchi.

That's all! This is a cheap and easy meal for those nights where I just don't feel like cooking. You can buy the ingredients well in advance, since they can stay in your pantry for months. This recipe feeds 2 people with 2€ worth of ingredients, but you will have leftover pesto and passata. If you triple the amount of gnocchi, you can feed 6 people with 3.50€.
