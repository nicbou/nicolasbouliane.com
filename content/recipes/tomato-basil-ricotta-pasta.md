## Ingredients

- 500 g vine tomatoes, or cherry tomatoes, in halves
- 300 g fusilli, or penne
- 1 bunch basil, or 1/2 cup before chopping
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp butter
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 1 pinch salt
- pepper
- Ricotta, for serving

## Preparation

1. Begin boiling salted water for the pasta.
2. While the pasta is cooking, cook the **garlic** in **olive oil** until fragrant.
3. Add the **tomatoes** and a generous pinch of **salt**. Cook covered until the tomatoes peel off and become slightly mushy - about 10 minutes. Add pasta water as necessary.
4. While the sauce is simmering, cook the **fusilli**. This takes around 10 minutes.
5. Add **pepper**, **butter** and chopped **basil**.
6. Mix into a chunky sauce, adding pasta water as needed, and cook for 2 or 3 minutes longer.
7. Serve sauce on top of pasta with a dollop of **ricotta** (optional)

This is a simple, tasty weekday recipe. It's much better in the summer, when you can find juicy vine tomatoes (*Rispentomaten*) and use some of your own basil. The ricotta is entirely optional. I stopped adding it because I end up wasting what's left of it.

This recipe is adapted from [the original one on Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/fresh-tomato-basil-pasta-with-ricotta/). Mine produces a little more sauce, but the original is also excellent.
