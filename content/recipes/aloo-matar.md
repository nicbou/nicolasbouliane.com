## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp oil
- 1/2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 cup red onions, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 inch fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
- 1 green chili, chopped
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 1/2 tsp garam masala
- 1/2 tsp red chili powder
- 400 g canned whole tomatoes
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- Water
- 3 large potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 cm cubes
- 1/2 cup frozen green peas
- 2 tablespoons chopped coriander (cilantro) leaves
- 3 tablespoons coconut milk
- Salt to taste

Optional:

- 1/2 tsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)
- Coriander (cilantro) leaves, to garnish
- Naan, paratha or rice

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large frying pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Stir fry **cumin seeds** for 30 seconds.
3. Add **onions**. Sauté until browned.
4. Add **garlic**, **ginger**, and **green chilies**. Sauté, stirring, for one minute or until fragrant.
5. Add **turmeric**, **coriander**, **garam masala**, and **chili powder**. Sauté, stirring, for 1 minute or until aromatic.
6. Add **canned tomatoes** and **tomato paste**. Cook until oil separates and floats to the top. Add **water** as needed - around 1 cup.
7. Add **potatoes**. Stir to combine. Season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender. Add water as needed. At this point, I like to mash some of the potatoes to thicken everything.
8. Add **green peas**. Cooked until sauce is thick and peas are cooked.
9. Add **cilantro**, **dried fenugreek leaves** and **coconut milk**. Stir to combine. Simmer for a minute.
11. Serve with naan, roti, paratha, or steamed rice. Garnish with coriander (cilantro) leaves.

## Notes for next time

- Use more spice. It could 20% be hotter and spicier.
- Cut the potatoes smaller. Partially crush them with a potato masher before adding the peas.
- Don't cook the garlic for long, to get a stronger garlic taste
