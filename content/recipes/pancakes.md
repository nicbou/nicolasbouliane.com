This is how you make batter for thin French crêpes. The ratio of ingredients is 2-2-1: 2 parts eggs, 2 parts milk, 1 part flour by weight. Calculate two eggs per person.

I use a separate recipe for [fluffy American pancakes](/recipes/thick-pancakes).

## Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 200 g milk
- 100 g flour
- 1 tsp baking powder (optional)
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- Butter, for cooking

## Preparation

1. Whisk the **flour** and **baking powder** together in a bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk the **milk**, **eggs** and **vanilla extract** together.
3. Slowly mix the wet ingredients into the wet ingredients.
4. Heat a non-stick pan on medium heat.
5. Drop a teaspoon of **butter** in the pan.
6. Pour some batter in the pan, and swirl it around until it covers the pan. Use as little batter as possible.
7. Cook the crêpe until it's solid enough to flip - about a minute. [Flip it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0A-Uo8kkPI), and cook for a little longer.
8. Repeat until you run out of batter

This can be served in different ways:

- With fruit and [chocolate syrup](/recipes/chocolate-syrup)
- With maple syrup
- With Nutella and bananas
- With brown sugar
