## Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 200 g milk
- 100 g flour
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- Butter, for cooking

## Preparation

This is how you make batter for thin French crêpes. The recipe's name comes from the ratio of ingredients, by weight. That means 2 parts eggs, 2 parts milk, 1 part flour. Calculate two eggs per person.

1. Whisk the flour and the eggs in a bowl, then add the milk and vanilla extract.
2. Heat a non-stick pan on medium heat
3. Drop a teaspoon of butter in the pan
4. Pour some batter in the pan, and swirl it around until it covers the pan. Use as little batter as possible.
5. Cook the crêpe until it's solid enough to flip - about a minute. [Flip it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0A-Uo8kkPI), and cook for a little longer.
6. Repeat until you run out of batter

This can be served in different ways:

- With fruit and [chocolate syrup](/recipes/chocolate-syrup)
- With maple syrup
- With Nutella and bananas
- With brown sugar
