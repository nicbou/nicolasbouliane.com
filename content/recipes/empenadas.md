## Preparation

This is the recipe from [delish](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a52606/beef-empanadas-recipe/), converted to metric. This is a *slightly* spicy recipe. It yields about 25 empanadas.

The filling can also be used on nachos if you're not into dough-making.

## Step 1: Dough

1. In a large bowl, mix **flour**, 1 teaspoon **salt** and **baking powder**.
2. Add **butter cubes**, 1 **egg** and **water** to the bowl.
3. Knead the dough until smooth, adding flour as necessary (I added a whole cup).
4. Wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour.

## Step 2: Filling

1. Heat **olive oil** a pan over medium heat
2. Add onion and cook until soft - about 5 minutes.
3. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.
4. Add the **beef** and cook until browned.
5. Add...
    1. 1 tbsp **tomato paste**,
    2. 1 tsp **organo**,
    3. 1 tsp **cumin**,
    4. 0.5 tsp **paprika**,
    5. 1 tsp **salt**,
    6. **black pepper**,
    7. **pickled jalapeños**,
    8. and **tomato** to the meat
6. Cook for an extra 3 minutes and remove from heat.

## Step 3: Assembly

1. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface
2. Cut ~10 cm, ~4 mm thick circles with a large mug
3. Place a tablespoon of meat and cheese on the centre of each circle. Dip a finger in water, and run it around the rim of each circle.
4. Close each pocket by folding it in half, using the fork to seal the edge.
5. Brush each empanada with egg wash (1 **egg**, 1 tablespoon **water**, whisked).

## Step 4: Cooking

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the empanadas on the sheet.
2. Bake at 205ºC until golden - about 25 minutes.
3. Serve with sour cream
