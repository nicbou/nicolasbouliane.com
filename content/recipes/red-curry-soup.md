## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp butter (or coconut oil)
- 1 large yellow onion
- 4 tbsp red curry paste
- 350 g carrots, sliced
- 1 sweet potato (350g), diced in small cubes
- 4 tbsp full fat coconut milk (add more to taste)
- 3 cups vegetable broth
- salt and pepper to taste

## Preparation

1. Cook **onion** in **butter** until soft and translucent
2. Add **curry paste**, cook for 1 minute
3. Add **sweet potato**, cook for 3-5 minutes. Smaller chunks cook faster.
4. Add **carrots** and **vegetable broth**.
5. Stir, add lid, cook to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer.
6. Cook covered until potatoes break apart when stirring, around 30 minutes. 
7. Blend together.
7. Add **salt**, **pepper** and **coconut milk** to taste. It uses quite a bit of salt. The original recipe calls for a full can of coconut milk, but I'm happy with much less.

The original recipe is from [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/thai-coconut-curry-carrot-soup/). I adapted it to European portion sizes, and to my own taste.
