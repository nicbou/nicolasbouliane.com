This is my personal website, built with [Ursus](https://github.com/all-about-berlin/ursus). You can see it at <nicolasbouliane.com>. It's a reference implementation of an [Ursus](https://github.com/all-about-berlin/ursus) website.

The server that serves this website is [here](https://github.com/nicbou/nicolasbouliane.com-server).

# How to use

When inside the repository, run `ursus` to build the website. See `ursus --help` for a list of options. More information in the [Ursus](https://github.com/all-about-berlin/ursus) README.

This will generate a static website. You will need a static file server to host those files. You can choose any. I use this [reference implementation](https://github.com/nicbou/nicolasbouliane.com-server)
